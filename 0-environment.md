# Set up your environment

* Set up a communications hub (I use a Discord server, freely and quickly available from https://discord.gg)
* Establish a Code of Conduct that communicates the ground rules for prospective team members.
	* Write down rules by which you want yourself and your teammates to follow.
	* Communicate those rules by putting them in a prominent location on your Discord server

Think about the kind of envrionment in which you want to operate.  If you have any specific needs for that environment, document those needs somewhere.  Consider these questions:

* Are there any behavioral standards you want held among your potential teammates?
* Do you require people to be present in voice chat?
* Do you have a nickname standard you want enforced?
* Do you want people to use specific in-game channels for specific reasons?
* Do you want all player characters to be Lalafells?
* Do you want pepole to wear silly hats?

The FFXIV TOS covers prohibited behaviors in-game, and Discord TOS covers prohibited behaviors in Discord, so a lot of this work is already done for you if you decide to use Discord.  If you require anything particular beyond that then that is up to you to decide and communicate.
