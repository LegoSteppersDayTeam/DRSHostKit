* Set up a Discord server 
* Establish a Code of Conduct that communicates the ground rules for prospective team members.

	Think about the kind of envrionment in which you want to operate.  If you have any specific needs for that environment, document those needs somewhere.  Consider these questions:

	* Are there any behavioral standards you want held among your potential teammates?
	* Do you require people to be present in voice chat?
	* Do you have a nickname standard you want enforced?
	* Do you want people to use specific in-game channels for specific reasons?
	* Do you want all player characters to be Lalafells?
	* Do you want pepole to wear silly hats?

	The FFXIV TOS covers prohibited behaviors in-game, and Discord TOS covers prohibited behaviors in Discord, so some of this work is already done for you.  If you require anything particular beyond that then that is up to you to decide and communicate.
