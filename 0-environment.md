# Environment Prep

* Set up a Discord server, freely and quickly available from https://discord.gg
* Establish a Code of Conduct that communicates the ground rules for prospective team members.
	* Write down rules by which you want yourself and your teammates to follow.
	* Communicate those rules by putting them in a prominent location in your communications hub

Think about the kind of envrionment in which you want to operate.  If you have any specific needs for that environment, document those needs in a public place so your prospective teammates can see them and decide for themselves if they want to follow those rules and join your event.  Consider these questions:

* Are there any behavioral standards you want held among your potential teammates?
* Do you require people to be present in voice chat?
* Do you have a nickname standard you want enforced?
* Do you want people to use specific in-game channels for specific reasons?
* Do you want all player characters to be Lalafells?
* Do you want pepole to wear silly hats?

The FFXIV TOS covers prohibited behaviors in-game, and Discord TOS covers prohibited behaviors in Discord if you go the Discord server route, so a lot of this work is already done for you.  If you require anything particular beyond that then that is up to you to decide and communicate.

Also, don't feel pressured to define this list right away.  Just make a list of things you can think of off the top of your head, write them down, and then show that list.  Edit it as you get more experience as a raid leader

* Establish your holster requirements.  Be sure to define and declare what you want your teammates to bring

DRS requires more than just food, pots, and skill.  There are special actions appraised from fragments which drop from mobs in Bozjan Southern Front (BSF), including Castrum Lacus Litore (CLL), which are required by mechanics in DRS.  At a minimum, you want:

* Steelsting
* Spellforge
* Reflect
* Dispel
* Aethershield (from a true tank) for TA and Queen raidwides
