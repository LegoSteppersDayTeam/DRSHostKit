# DRSHostKit
a step-by-step walkthrough to leading a pick-up group (PUG) of 24-48 players into Delubrum Reginae Savage, from someone who leads a regularly-scheduled, publicly-available raid into DRS at least once a week and has done so since March 2021

This is what I do when I lead teams into DRS.  I'm not going to claim this is the best way, but it's worked for me consistently over the last 3 years and counting, and I'll probably be doing something similar for Dawntrail's Savage Foray if that comes out.

I take everyone, from people who've cleared Ultimate raids to people who don't consider themselves raiders and are discovering content for the first time.

I don't require any pre-study or video guide watching.  YoshiP & co made this content for us to enjoy, and I don't want to tell people that they have to give up the joy of seeing mechanics for the first time.  I take all groups in with the understanding that a clear is always possible by following my raid plan but should not be expected.

All this is to say that this guide is meant to be used for leading a group of people of unknown and possibly zero raid experience mixed with people who are experts at raiding.  A lot of what I do when leading DRS is expectation management, so this guide is written with all of that in mind--a distillation of leading a new group of people in and to the eventual clear more or less weekly for the last 3 years.

Note: This walkthrough frequently uses collapsed sections to hide details & rationale.  If you see:

  <summary><b><i>âš Notes (<-- click this)</i></b></summary>
    I have notes in sections like these that are not shown by default so as to decrease the initial amount of information being presented on a page.  There's a lot of information that goes into leading a viable DRS run, and I'm not trying to to firehose you with it.  If you want rationale, make sure to check these <b><i>Notes</i></b> sections.
