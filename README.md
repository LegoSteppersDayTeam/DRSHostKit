# DRSHostKit
a step-by-step walkthrough of how I lead a DRS run, in the hopes that this facilitates access to DRS in the future when persistent DRS operations come to an end

This is what I do when I lead teams into DRS.  I'm not going to claim this is the best way, but it's worked for me consistently over the last 3 years and counting, and I'll probably be conducting my Dawntrail Savage Foray events in a similar manner if/when that comes out.

This guide is meant to be used for leading a group of people of unknown and possibly zero raid experience mixed with people who have experience with raiding or even with DRS itself.It is a distillation of my experience leading a new group of people in and to the eventual clear more or less weekly for the last 3 years.

Note: This walkthrough frequently uses collapsed sections to hide details & rationale.  If you see:

  <summary><b><i>âš Notes (<-- click this)</i></b></summary>
    I have notes in sections like these that are not shown by default so as to decrease the initial amount of information being presented on a page.  There's a lot of information that goes into leading a viable DRS run, and I'm not trying to to firehose you with it.  If you want rationale, make sure to check these <b><i>Notes</i></b> sections.
