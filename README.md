# DRSHostKit
a step-by-step walkthrough to leading groups of 24-48 players into Delubrum Reginae Savage in the style of Nacl Free of Lego Steppers/Day Team

Note: This walkthrough frequently uses collapsed sections to hide details & rationale.  If you see:

<details>
  <summary><b><i>âš Notes (<-- click this)</i></b></summary>
    I have notes in sections like these that are not shown by default so as to decrease the initial amount of information being presented on a page.  There's a lot of information that goes into leading a viable DRS run, and I'm not trying to to firehose you with it.  If you want rationale, make sure to check these <b><i>Notes</i></b> sections.
