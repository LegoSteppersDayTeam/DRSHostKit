# Step 7. Trinity Seeker recovery to Dahu engagement, Duelist sweep/departure

1. After Trinity Seeker is defeated, instruct the raid to remain inside the Trinity Seeker arena.  Dispatch the duelist to use their lost perception to reveal traps on the way to Dahu before departing for the duel pad.
2. Once all 6 traps have been revealed, instruct the raid to proceed to the area in front of the door opening the way to Dahu's arena.
3. Do pre-fight briefing while waiting at the open door for the duelist to start the duel.
4. Once the duel has started, there will be an RP message on the screen.  The raid is clear to engage Dahu from that moment on.
