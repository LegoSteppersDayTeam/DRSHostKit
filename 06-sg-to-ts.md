# Step 6. Slime/Golem recovery to Trinity Seeker engagement

1. Instruct teammates not to depart Barracks/Granary areas before checking if all teammates are alive and connected to the game.  If a disconnect occurred mid-combat, the disconnected individual may return dead after reconnecting to the game, so ensure people are around to Raise them if necessary.
2. After ressing and jumping on the exit teleport pad, remind raid members to personally loot all chests after combat, as all loot is personal loot.  Remind raiders that there are 2 chests at the bottom of the stairwell prior to Trinity Seeker.
3. Brief raid as necessary on caller's approach to Trinity Seeker.
4. Identify a main tank if necessary
5. Brief main tank if necessary
6. Start countdown and engage.
