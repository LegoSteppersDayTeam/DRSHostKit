# Step 2. In-Game Prep up to clicking "Recruit Members"

Starting about 1-2 hours before raid.  These steps are a mix of in-game and in comms hub (ex: Lego Steppers/Day Team discord) actions prior to raid marshalling.

1. Configure the "Recruitment Criteria" window as follows:

* Select "Duty Completion" as Objective, and enable "🌱Beginners/first-timers welcome"
* Alliances A through E - 2 tanks, 2 healers, 1 melee DPS, 1 physical ranged DPS, 1 magical DPS, and 1 additional DPS of any sort
* Alliance F - 2 tanks, 2 healers, 1 melee DPS, 1 physical ranged DPS, 1 non-BLM magical DPS, and 1 BLM
* Select "One Player Per Job"
* Select "Form a Private Party" and set the password to 0000 or 9999
* ⛔⛔⛔DO NOT CLICK "Recruit Members" YET⛔⛔⛔

2. Without clicking "Recruit Members", take a cropped screenshot of the "Recruitment Criteria" window with WIN KEY + Shift + S and share this to your community's comms hub.  Follow any applicable rules specific to your comms hub for doing this.

3. Modify the following text and paste the resulting string into your comms hub in a message immediately following the one sharing the cropped screenshot:

> I click "Recruit Members" at <t:0:F> <t:0:R> with window configured exactly as above.  Follow all instructions mentioned in MESSAGE_LINK.  If you are having trouble understanding or complying, ask for help in #general.

> I open to pseudotanks/pseudoheals at start time +5 minutes.  Quorum & compliance check and start of raid assignments at +15.  We queue in when everyone passes ready check.

> Si se no hablan ingles diceme para puedo tratar de ayudarte.  英語出来ない方俺におしえて。 Deaf & hearing impaired welcome, just tell me if you will not join voice.

A few things to note here:
* I don't screen for talent or experience, so I try to keep things as familiar as possible to decrease the amount of initial learning one needs to do to meet minimum effectiveness requirements in a DRS raid.
* I *do* screen for ability and willingness to follow instructions and pay attention to detail.  Regardless of experience one can choose to try to find and follow written instructions or not, and experience has no bearing on this behavior.
