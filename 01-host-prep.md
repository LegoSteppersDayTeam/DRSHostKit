#Step 1. Pre-Game Host Prep
What to do before you even start the game

1. Decide on and commit to a 5-hour block of time which you can dedicate to leading a raid.

You want to account for roughly 1 hour of pre-instance prep, about 1 hour of buffer time for slime/golem wipes and calls for reinforcement when people drop out, and then 3 hours max for a run.  It is definitely possible to execute a DRS raid faster than this, but I assume that new players who are with us have no clue as far as how to handle mechanics in upcoming fights.

2. Publicly announce 1 week ahead of time when (date and time, and timezone if applicable) and where (What server, what Datacenter, and what Region) you will hold your event.

It's very, very hard to summon 47 other teammates whole cloth and have them dedicate a block of 4-5 hours for DRS, so you'll want to establish some sort of schedule beforehand.  I do this by both announcing I will run a week ahead of time, and also sticking with a regularly-scheduled weekly run.  A regularly scheduled event helps people both plan their own schedules around your event, and provides a base assumption that they can recommend your event to other people knowing you will be holding it at a known time and regularity.
