# Step 10. Bozjan Phantom recovery to Trinity Avowed engagement

1. Immediately instruct your teammates to remain in the phantom arena, as there are traps on the way down to Trinity Avowed.
2. Dispatch Sweep 2, as they are the designated individual who brought Lost Perception.  This individual should load Lost Perception into an active skill slot and spam it while carefully moving ahead of the Phantom Arena and all the way until they reach the Trinity Avowed arena.  There are six traps to reveal between the Phantom Arena and the Trinity Avowed arena:
	1. One trap somewhere in front of the door leading into the hallway connecting the room after the Phantom Arena to the stairs going down
	2. One trap in the connecting hallway BEFORE the stairs
	3. One trap in the connecting hallway AFTER the stairs
	4. Three traps in the room before the stairs leading down to the TA arena
3. Take a break for 5 minutes
4. Ready check all parties to make sure everyone has returned from break.  You don't want to be issuing instructions to an empty chair.
4. Advise tanks to swap in Aethershield
4. Issue any advisory remarks about the upcoming fight to your team members as desired
5. Ready check all parties
6. Countdown and pull
