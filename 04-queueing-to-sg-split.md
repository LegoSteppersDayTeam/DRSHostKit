# Step 4. In-instance prep - from queueing into DRS to slime/golem split
You have just entered the instance.  This is when you want to direct your raid to pre-pop and pack their jump holsters to meet requirements.

1. While still in the circle after instancing in, load floor marker configuration used for marking the stairway such that A, B, and C teams will stand on the west half of the stairway and D, E, and F teams will stand on the east half of the stairway.  If you don't have the markers for assembling on the stairs, proceed to 2 and manually place (and save) the markers once the instance start ring wall goes away.
2. Instruct your raid to do the following:
	1. Do **NOT** touch the glowing circles next to the Lost Finds Cache.
	2. Use their pre-pop holster (Pure essence, reraiser, first two lost actions)
	3. After using all pre-pop items, load their jump holster and fill remaining empty space with whatever they thing will be useful (i.e. more reraiser, 2 light curtains, resistance potion, etc)
	4. After loading their jump holster, members should move to stand on marker waypoints on stairway corresponding to their teams A through F.  E and F teams will use markers 1 and 2 respectively.
	5. Remind all members to click the "Lost Finds Holster" button when they move away from the cache and check that the holster is configured as intended.
	6. Remind all members to fill empty space, and give the explicit example of filling space if holsters are at 97 or 98 out of 99.  Light Curtain and Resistance Potion are both 1 weight, so no one should be leaving with any empty space at all.
	7. Once an entire team is on a floor marker, check party members in the party list for pure essence, reraiser, and initial lost actions via the tooltip of each party member's Reminiscence buff.  Encourage party members to ask each other questions if the Reminiscence buff looks incorrect and treat it as a teachable moment either for the person with incorrect actions, or the asker for not realizing correct actions were loaded.
	8. Remind the raid that there will be a deputy raid leader in charge of the portion of the raid that is not with the raid leader.  If multiple voice chat rooms are used, make sure to mention who needs to go to which room
3. Once the cache has cleared, ask for all teams to run an /rcheck and report in shout chat when they are ready.
4. Ask Sweeps 2 and 3 to check and confirm in shout chat that they have Lost Perception in their holsters
5. Once all teams have reported ready, issue instruction "JUMP JUMP JUMP"
