# Step 8. Dahu recovery to Queen's Guard engagement

1. Remind folks that the upcoming jump pad from Dahu's arena to the Queen's Guard arena is a one-way jump pad.
	1. Healers should make sure there are no dead teammates before leaving the area
	2. Raid members should be sure they've looted all 4 treasure chests up to this point: 2 before TS, 1 after TS, and 1 after Dahu
2. At Queen's Guard, make sure there are:
	1. 6 tanks that will invuln specific things: 2 Gun Turret Sniper Shots and 4 Aura Sphere Spite Smites
	2. Someone to give steelsting/spellforge within each party for the first pair of the fight (Knight/Warrior)
	3. Someone to dispel the Warrior's Boost
	4. 6 people who will reflect 12 Spiritual Spheres at the end of the fight
	5. 2 main tanks to keep the two mobs separated for both Knight/Warrior phase and Soldier/Gunner phase
3. Instruct steelsting/spellforge buffers to wait until the countdown starts to buff their teammates.
4. If you have any points about the upcoming fight you want to highlight, make sure to mention them.
3. Once all teams are ready, instruct all tanks to turn on their tank stances and fight for threat among all 4 targets during the opening phase.
4. Countdown and engage.
