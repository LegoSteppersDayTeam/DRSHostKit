# Step 9. Queen's Guard recovery to Bozjan Phantom engagement

1. After the fight, if there was a successful duel earlier then there will be a 2nd chest after Queen's Guard with a hand token.  Make sure to recognize, thank, and encourage your raid to thank the duelist for clearing the duel and getting everyone in the raid their hand token.
2. At phantom, make sure all teams are ready because sometimes people will elect to go to the bathroom without letting anyone know after Queen's Guard.
3. If you have any words of advice about the upcoming fight for your raid, make sure to mention them.
3. Countdown and pull.
