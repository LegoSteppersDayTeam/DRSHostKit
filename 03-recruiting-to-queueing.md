# Step 3. Marshalling - from clicking "Recruit Members" to queueing into DRS
You just clicked "Recruit Members" and people are showing up.  This is what you do prior to queueing into instance.

1. Join voice chat
2. Type in-game in `/alliance` to instruct all alliance members to join Voice Chat.  If you have Discord server nickname requirements, remind people to update server nicknames according to your requirements.
3. Welcome people to voice chat.  State your name and acknowledge that you will be leading your event to people in voice chat.

Example:
> ðŸ”Š HELLO. MY NAME IS NACL FREE AND I WILL BE LEADING YOU INTO DRS TODAY.

You do this because people in voice chat might not realize who the raid leader is or what you sound like in voice, so this introduction is critical and your teammates are more likely to recognize your spoken words as actual instructions as opposed to suggestions or recommendations from a non-leader teammate.

4. Either take volunteers or pick people to do the following:

* Shellers 1 and 2.  Shellers will bring a single Lost Shell II or I (II preferred, but I is still serviceable) and apply it to the entire raid.  Sheller 1 will do it before the raid engages TA and Sheller 2 will do it before the raid engages the Queen.
* Sweeps 2 and 3.  "Sweep 2" will be sweeping the second set of traps between Phantom and TA.  "Sweep 3" will sweep for traps between TA and Stygimoloch Lord.  Trap sweeping is critical to revealing the pink mini trap to use after defeating TA to open the way forward to the Stygimoloch Lord encounter.
* Duelist/Sweep 1.  Ideally a DPS who has cleared DRS but has not yet cleared the duel.  This person will sweep for 6 traps after Trinity Seeker on the way to the Dahu arena, and then depart for the duel.
* Flarestar BLM.  This is the BLM in the job-locked slot in F.
* Rends 1 and 2.  These two melee DPS raid members will work together to apply Lost Rend Armor to enraging bosses and boost raid damage by 10% throughout those encounters.
* Slime/Golem Leads.  The raid will initially split into two parts to tackle the Barracks aka "Slime side" and Granary aka "Golem side" encounters.  The raid host is usually one of these, and a temporary deputy will lead the other team.
* A-F Team Leads.  These individuals will help run the raid by running `/rcheck` for their respective teams while in-instance.  They are also responsible for elevating any party issues to the host if there is some party-level issue that cannot be resolved within that party.

Volunteers will sometimes self-identify in `/alliance` chat in-game.  In situations where no one volunteers for a critical role, you as the raid host will pick someone.  Make sure they respond in `/alliance` chat in-game if you pick someone for one of these responsibilities and that they acknowledge they will do what you are asking them to do.  Make sure all communications loops are closed and that there are no open or pending unanswered questions.

5. Note any member flexing required to execute slime/golem fight plans, and make sure flexing members know where they need to go as necessary.

6. Start running /rcheck and wait for all team mates to indicate readiness.  If the /rcheck fails, wait for the missing members to indicate they have returned, then run /rcheck again.  Repeat this process until all team members indicate ready.  Make sure to mention that these /rchecks are not intended to rush people into getting ready, and if a member is not ready they should click "no" on the ready check and continue making preparations.

Frequently when an /rcheck fails, other people in the raid will take the opportunity to take care of something "in the meanwhile" so one should never assume that all team members are present if the people who did not answer the ready check indicate that they have returned.  Keep running the ready check until everyone is present.

7.  Once all members have indicated ready, Queue into DRS by talking to the Troubled Gentleman in Gangos.
