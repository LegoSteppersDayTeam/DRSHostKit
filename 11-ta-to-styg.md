# Step 11. Trinity Avowed recovery to Stygimoloch Lord engagement

1. Immediately instruct your raid to remain in the Trinity Avowed arena.
2. Once all deaths have been resolved, lead the new members who have just beaten TA for the first time back to the room with the 3 traps in it.  At least one of those traps should be colored pink with a depiction of a shrinking person.  Have your teammates gather next to the pink trap without triggering it.
3. Explain what your teammates need to do before triggering the trap: Take the teleport pad after the TA arena and walk into the middle of the barred gate on the other side.
4. Have Sweep 3 load Lost Perception and stand by next to the gate on the far side of the teleport pad after the TA arena.
5. Trigger the pink mini trap and open the way forward to Stygimoloch Lord by walking into the barred gate.
6. Once the gate is open, have Sweep 3 go downstairs and trap sweep by spamming Lost Perception to reveal 3 traps: 2 in the room and 1 on the bridge
7. Advise the rest of the raid to carefully go downstiars to the Stygimoloch Lord arena
8. Advise individuals affected by the Mini debuff to stop movement when the timer on the debuff is close to 0, as they might not expect the return to normal walking speed and accidentally walk into a trap if they are still en route.
9. Designate reflectors, dispellers, and 4 add pullers
10. Brief raid on movements you want them to make during the next fight
11. Countdown and engage
